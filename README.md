# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Running DB Server

There is no DB Server associated with this APP but there is a local JSON that contains data that we will load onto our application
to do that you need to install ####JSON-Server after that you need to open a seperate Terminal and run the code `json-server -p 4000 -w ./data/db.json`
